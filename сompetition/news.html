                          <h3>Having already resigned the sovereignty of the Netherlands in 1555, Charles V resigned Spain on January 16th, 1556.</h3>
                          <p>In theory, Charles  V was the most powerful monarch in Europe. A Habsburg, in his teens in 1516 he inherited Spain, which had been united by his grandparents Ferdinand and Isabella. In 1519 he succeded his paternal grandfather Maximilian I as Holy Roman Emperor.</p>
                          <p>He was Duke of Burgundy and Archduke of Austria and he also ruled the Netherlands, Bohemia, Hungary, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia. Ruling Spain meant ruling Spanish America and in Charles’s time Cortés took Mexico and Pizarro conquered Peru. The wealth of Spain paid for his efforts to control western Europe.</p>
                          <p>A fervent Roman Catholic, Charles hoped to unite all Europe in a Christian empire. Not only did the French and the English prove resistant to the idea, however, but in 1517 Martin Luther nailed his theses to the church door at Wittenberg: Charles’s ambitions foundered on the Protestant Reformation.</p>
                          <ol>

                          </ol>
                          <p>Charles hoped that Philip would eventually rule his whole empire, but the empire was too big to manage, Ferdinand and his son Maximilian refused to accept Philip’s succession and the Habsburg dynasty split into Austrian and Spanish branches. Charles himself spent his last days in Spain in a house close to a monastery, with a household some fifty strong. Visitors kept him in touch with events and he did his best to ensure the continued persecution of Protestants. He had taken his favourite books and pictures with him and he enjoyed shooting </p>

                            <span>House of Habsburg’s European dominion after Charles’ abdication.</span>
                            <p>From his Burgundian ancestors he inherited an ambiguous relationship with the Kings of France. Charles shared with France his mother tongue and many cultural forms. In his youth he made frequent visits to Paris, then the largest city of Western Europe. In his words: "Paris is not a city, but a universe" (Lutetia non-urbs, sed orbis). He was betrothed to both Louise and Charlotte of Valois, daughters of King Francis I of France, but they both died in childhood. Charles also inherited the tradition of political and dynastic enmity between the Royal and the Burgundian Ducal lines of the Valois Dynasty. Charles was very attached to the Burgundian Low Countries where he had been raised. These lands were very rich and contributed significantly to the wealth of the Empire. He also spent much time there, mainly at Brussels. This stands in contrast with the attitude of his son Philip who only went once to the Low Countries.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Until the 1540s, Charles did not spend much time in Germany, though he was frequently quite close to it (in the Netherlands or North Italy). He never actually governed his Austrian dominions and made his brother Ferdinand the effective ruler of these lands as well as his representative in the Holy Roman Empire during his absence. In spite of this, the Emperor had a close relationship with some German families, like the House of Nassau, many of which were represented at his court in Brussels. Some German princes or noblemen accompanied him in his military campaigns against France or the Ottomans and the bulk of his army was generally composed of German troops, especially the Imperial Landsknechte. Indeed, in 1519, he was elected because he was considered a German prince while his main opponent was French. Nonetheless, in the long term, the growth of Lutheranism and Charles' staunch Catholicism alienated him from various German princes who finally fought against him in the 1540s and the 1550s. It is important to note, though, that other states of the Empire chose to support him in his war, and that he had the constant support of his brother, in spite of their strained personal relationship. Whereas Charles spent much of his final years as a ruler trying to address the issue of religion in the Empire, it would ultimately be Ferdinand, by then much more popular in Germany, who would bring peace to the German lands.</p>
